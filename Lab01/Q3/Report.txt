1.  When the TCP client application is started without the TCP server running, the client will likely hang or fail to connect. 
    This is because TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, and the client needs an active server to establish a connection. 
    The client will keep trying to establish a connection with the server and will eventually time out or display an error message.

2.  Unlike TCP, UDP is a connectionless protocol, so starting the UDP client application without the UDP server running will not cause the client to hang or fail immediately. 
    The client will send UDP datagrams to the specified server address and port, and if the server is not running, the datagrams will likely be lost in the network without any acknowledgment. 
    The client will not receive any response from the server because there is no inherent acknowledgment mechanism in UDP.
